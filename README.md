# Millionaire-Programmer
This is an imitation of "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?" game, which is my favorite TV show of all times! My version is called "Who Does Not Want To Be A Millionaire Programmer?"  Briefly, this is a fun quiz game based on Python programming language, unfortunately, with no prize :)
